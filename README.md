# Oil Case Analysis and World Development Indicators (WDI) Subset Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes oil production data and its impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) using various statistical techniques in R. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, regression models, and discussions on the implications of the findings.

## Data and Variables
The dataset includes variables related to oil production, GDP, political stability, labor force participation, and more. Key variables analyzed include:

Oil Production (Physical Measure)
Net Value of Oil Exports (in US Dollars)
GDP per Capita (in US Dollars)
Political Stability (Polity Index)
Labor Force Participation (Female)
GDP Growth Rate
Natural Conflict Onset
Population Size
Age Dependency Ratio
Birth Rate per 1000
Methodology and Techniques
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

## Loaded and cleaned the dataset using readr library.
Checked for missing values and performed necessary data transformations.

## Descriptive Statistics:
Computed descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for key variables.

## Data Visualizations:
Created line plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices using ggplot2 and corrplot libraries.
Visualized trends, relationships, and correlations between variables.

## Regression Analysis:
Conducted linear regression analysis to model relationships between variables.
Examined coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values to assess significance and impact.

## Discussion and Implications:
Interpreted analysis findings and discussed implications for oil production, GDP, political stability, and societal factors.
Explored confounding variables and potential biases in the analysis.

## Files Included
R Script:
Contains the R code used for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

README File:
This document providing an overview of the project, methodology, key variables, and techniques used.

## Instructions for Replication
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install R and the required libraries (readr, ggplot2, psych, corrplot, lm) if not already installed.
Run the provided R script in your preferred R environment or IDE to replicate the analysis.
Modify the code or add additional analyses as needed for further exploration.

## Conclusion
This project offers insights into the relationships between oil production, GDP, political stability, and other socio-economic factors. The findings contribute to understanding the impact of oil on economies and societal dynamics.
